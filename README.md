## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
While building the application I felt that I had to brush up on my skills dealing with classes, methods and constructors that I learned from Programming 1. While also trying to
learn the new syntax and tools that were being presented in the process. I also ran into a few issues with my "Toast" notifications not being displayed even though I made sure 
of including the ".Show();" at the end of the line. So in order to correct this issue I had to change the API version that I was using from "R" back to "Q".
